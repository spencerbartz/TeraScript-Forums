# TeraScript-Forums
Posting / Comment Forum software created using Javascript, CSS, MySQL, and a TeraScript (Witango) back end.
This was a coding challenge I received for a job application at a Japanese-American startup. The deal-breaker for me this 
TeraScript language (which I'm sure none of you have heard of). Think Cold Fusion but with few docs and minimal updates. 
I completed a significant portion of the challenge before deciding it wasn't worth it (the pay was poor as well). If for some 
reason you wish to run this project, you can download the necessary TeraScript tools [here](https://www.terascript.com/) and 
give it a whirl. It's an obsolete platform but at least I proved I could get the job (mostly) done in a strange new environment.
